kspsig

Key Signing Party signature verification tool

If  you  are  concerned  about  the  hash algorithm strength used 
in key signing this tool seeks to answer questions you may have 
following a key signing party...
- How strongly did others sign my key?
- How strongly did I sign other's keys?
- How strong are the signatures for my key?

This tool only reads keyrings: it does not do any key modifications.

See the man page for additional documentation and examples


Requirements
------------

Depends on python 2.6 and assumes that gpg is installed.  
Although not strictly required it is assumed that caff is also installed.

The man page can be regenerated using help2man with:
$ help2man --output kspsig.1 --include=kspsig.h2m kspsig

To Do

  gpg --list-packets
- Consider rewriting with direct access to the keyrings
